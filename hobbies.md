# Baseline Model

This page hasn’t been updated for a long time. Over the past year, I’ve remained passionate about swimming, but the lack of convenient and decent swimming pools in Cambridge has been an inconvenience. As a result, I’ve been swimming less frequently and have gained some weight. If you’re also in Cambridge and interested in swimming, running, or hiking together, feel free to contact me!

## Swimming & Surfing

<br>Swimming removes my worries, refreshes my body, and brings me courage to address any challenges. I extremely enjoy the feeling of being immersed in the water. Besides, I am a member of the Swimming Team at Fuzhou University, where I meet many sincere friends. I have reached **China National Second-level athlete Standard** in 50m breaststroke and won **Five Gold Medals** during my 15-year swimming career. Recently, I am also keen on surfing.

## My Cat

She is my love. Her name is Qbao (Q宝).
